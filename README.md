# vuejs2-study

Here I will deposit the codes made during the course [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide) from Udemy.

Some projects were made with just the Vue.js framework, these can be run simply by opening the main HTML.
In others was used the [Vue-CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) with the webpack-simple configuration.
To run a project that used Vue-CLI (that you can spot by the presence of a package.json file) locally:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
